IN THIS ARTICLE YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT CHESS AND HOW TO PLAY IT.
LET'S START-
<H1>UNDERSTANDING CHESS</H1>
<P>
CHESS IS A STRATEGICAL GAME THAT REQUIRES PATIENCE,PRACTICE AND THE ABILITY TO CALCULATE YOUR MOVES.CHESS HAS SEEN MANY GRANDMASTERS,WORLD CHAMPIONS.
GARY KASPAROV, ANTOLY KARPOV,VISHWANATHAN ANAND AND MAGNUS CARLSEN ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST CHESS PLAYERS THAT EVER EXISTED.
IF YOU WANT TO EXCEL CHESS AND BECOME A STRONG PLAYER THAN READ THE ARTICLE BELOW.
</P>
<H1>THE CHESS BOARD</H1>
THE CHESS BOARD IS A SQUARE BOARD CONTAINING 64 SQUARES BOTH DARK AND LIGHT.THE BOARD IS DIVIDED INTO RANKS AND COLUMNS.COLUMNS ARE DENOTED 
BY LETTERS WHILE RANK IS DENOTED BY A NUMBER.EACH SQUARE HAS A SPECIAL NAME.
<H1>LEARN TO MOVE PEICES</H1>
<H2>PAWNS</H2>
<P>
    PAWNS CAN MOVE UPTO 2 SQUARES IN THE START BUT ONLY ONE SQUARES ONCE THEY HAVE MOVED.THEY CAN CAPTURE AN ENEMY PEICE IF IT IS IN ANOTHER ROW IN THE SQUARE WHICH 
    IS AT THE SIDE OF THE SQUARE IT WILL MOVE TO IN THE NEXT MOVE.IF THE PAWN REACHES THE LAST RANK THEN IT CAN BE PROMOTED TO A MINOR PEICE WE WANT.
</P>
<H2>KNIGHT</H2>
<P>
KNIGHT OR HORSE IS A VERY UNIQUE PEICE IN CHESS.IT IS THE ONLY PEICE THAT CAN JUMP OVER A PEICE.IT  MOVES 2 SQUARES IN THE FRONT AND ONE 
SQUARE IN THE SIDE AND CAN CAPTURE AN ENEMY PEICE IN ITS RANGE.AN IMPORTANT FACT ABOUT THE KNIGHT WORTH KNOWING IS THAT IT MOVES FROM
A LIGHT SQUARE TO A DARK ONE AND VICE VERSA.
</P>
<H2>BISHOP</H2>
<P>
EACH SIDE HAS 2 BISHOPS ,ONE LIGHT SQUARED AND THE OTHER DARK SQUARED AND CAN MOVE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE SQUARES DIAGONALLY.THESE PLAY A CRUCIAL 
ROLE IN THE MIDDLEGAME.A BISHOP CAN CAN CAPTURE AN ENEMY PEICE IN ITS AREA OF CONTROL.
</P>
<H2>ROOK</H2>
THE PAIR OF ROOKS CAN MOVE ANY NUMBER OF SQUARES VERTICALLY OR HORIZONTALLY IF PATH IS UNOBSTRUCTED.THE ROOKS ARE VERY VALUABLE AND MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANY OTHER PEICE IN THE ENDGAME.
<H2>THE QUEEN</H2>
QUEEN IS THE STRONGEST PEICE ON THE CHESS BOARD.IT HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE LIKE A ROOK AS WELL AS A BISHOP.UNLIKE THE KNIGHTS,BISHOPS AND ROOKS 
WHICH ARE IN A PAIR THERE IS ONLY A SINGLE QUEEN WITH EACH SIDE.
<H2>THE KING</H2>
IT IS THE MOST VALUABLE PEICE IN CHESS AROUND WHICH THE WHOLE BATTLE REVOLVES BUT IS THE SECOND WEAKEST PEICE AFTER PAWN WHICH CAN ONLY MOVE
IN ONE DIRECTION WHILE THE KING CAN MOVE ONE  SQUARE IN ANY DIRECTION IT WANTS.MANY MIGHT THINK WHY THE KING IS SO WEAK BUT IF THE KING WAS STRONG
IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO CHECKMATE IT.
<H1>IMPORTANT RULES</H1>
<H2>CASTLING</H2>
IT IS A SPECIAL MOVE AND THE ONLY MOVE THAT INVOLVES 2 PEICES,A ROOK AND THE KING AND THE KING IS ALLOWED TO MOVE 2 SQUARES TOWARDS THE ROOK.
CASTLING IS IMPORTANT FOR KING SAFETY.FOR CASTLING THE KING AND THE ROOK SHOLDNT HAVE MOVED EARLIER AND THE SQUARES BETWEEN THEM SHOULD BE FREE.
ALSO THE KING SHOULD NOT BE UNDER CHECK WHILE CASTLING.
<H2>CHECKMATE</H2>
IT IS A SITUTAION IN WHICH ONE OF THE KINGS IS DIRECTLY ATTACKED BY AN ENNEMY PEICE AND HAS NO PROTECTOR OR SAFE SQUARES TO MOVE TO AND IN 
THIS SITUTAION ONE OF THE SIDES WIN THE GAME.
<H2>STALEMATE</H2>
IT IS A SITUATION IN WHICH ONE OF THE SIDES HAS NO LEGAL MOVES LEFT . IN A STALLEMATE ALL THE ENEMY PEICES ARE LOST AND THE KING CANT MOVE 
OR ELSE HE WILL END IN A CHECK.ALSO IN A STALEMATE THE ENEMY KING SHOULDNT BE  IN A CHECK.A STALEMATE RESULTS IN A DRAW.
